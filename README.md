# To-Do List Application

## Description
This To-Do List application is a user-friendly platform that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can easily add tasks to their personal list, mark tasks as completed, and delete them as needed. Each user can create an account to maintain their own individual list, making task management both personal and secure.

## Key Areas
This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in several key areas of web development, including but not limited to:

- **React Hooks**: Utilizing React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage and persist state throughout the application.
- **PostgreSQL**: Implementing PostgreSQL for robust data storage and retrieval, ensuring that user tasks are persistent and secure.
- **User Authentication**: Incorporating user authentication to allow users to have private, secure access to their individual task lists.
- **CRUD Operations**: Applying Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations to interact with the PostgreSQL database, allowing users full control over their tasks.
